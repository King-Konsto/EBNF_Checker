# EBNF-Checker - a web-based EBNF simulation system

This project (bachelor thesis) was about developing a web-based EBNF simulation system that parses inserted EBNF grammars in a first step and interprets various manual inputs to this syntax in a second step.

- EBNF parser (JFlex / CUP)
- EBNF interpreter (self-developed)
- Web-based application (Google web toolkit)
